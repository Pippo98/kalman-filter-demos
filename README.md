> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always clone with the submodules, to do that use this command: `git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Pippo98/kalman-filter-demos.git`.

To build the project:
```bash
make release
```

To start the application:
```bash
./bin/core/kalman-filter_demos
```

The demo has an empty page, because it needs a telemetry log to run a simulation. To get that file ask directly the developer.
